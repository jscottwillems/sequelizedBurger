# Eat-Da-Burger

Use the buttons to eat a burger or delete it from the database. Burgers that haven't been eaten will be displayed in the left table
and those that have will be displayed in the right. You can add your own burger into the mix using the form at the bottom. The purpose of
this project was to get familiar with using express to interact with a MySQL database and handlebars to display the information on the DOM.

### Prerequisites

Requires mysql, express, body-parser, and express-handlebars
